# snarkjs

This is a **JavaScript and Pure Web Assembly implementation of zkSNARK and PLONK schemes.** It uses the Groth16 Protocol (3 point only and 3 pairings) and PLONK.

This library includes all the tools required to perform trusted setup multi-party ceremonies: including the universal [*powers of tau*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377) ceremony, and the second phase circuit specific ceremonies.

> Any zk-snark project can pick a round from the common phase 1 to start their circuit-specific phase 2 ceremony.

The formats used in this library for the multi-party computation are compatible with the ones used in [Semaphore's Perpetual Powers of Tau](https://github.com/weijiekoh/perpetualpowersoftau) and [other implementations](https://github.com/kobigurk/phase2-bn254).

This library uses the compiled circuits generated by the [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) compiler.

It works in [`node.js`](#using-node) as well as directly in the [browser](#in-the-browser).

It's an [ES module](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/), so it can be directly imported into bigger projects using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The low-level cryptography is performed directly in `wasm`, and uses worker threads to parallelize the computations. The result is a high performance library with benchmarks comparable to host implementations.

## Preliminaries

### Install node
First off, make sure you have a recent version of `Node.js` installed. While any version after `v12` should work fine, we recommend you install `v16` or later.

If you’re not sure which version of Node you have installed, you can run:

```sh
node -v
```

To download the latest version of Node, see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Install snarkjs

To install `snarkjs` run:

```sh
npm install -g snarkjs@latest
```

If you're seeing an error, try prefixing both commands with `sudo` and running them again.

### Understand the `help` command

To see a list of all `snarkjs` commands, as well as descriptions about their inputs and outputs, run:

```sh
snarkjs --help
```


You can also use the `--help` option with specific commands:

```sh
snarkjs groth16 prove --help
```

Most of the commands have an alternative shorter alias (which you can discover using `--help`).

For example, the previous command can also be invoked with:

```sh
snarkjs g16p --help
```

### Debugging tip

If you a feel a command is taking longer than it should, re-run it with a `-v` or `--verbose` option to see more details about how it's progressing and where it's getting blocked.

### Install circom

To install `circom`, follow the instructions at [installing circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation). 

## Guide

### 0. Create and move into a new directory
```sh
mkdir snarkjs_example
cd snarkjs_example
```

### 1. Start a new powers of tau ceremony
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 pot12_0000.ptau -v
```

The `new` command is used to start a powers of tau ceremony.

The first parameter after `new` refers to the type of curve you wish to use. At the moment, we support both `bn128` and `bls12-381`.

The second parameter, in this case `12`, is the power of two of the maximum number of constraints that the ceremony can accept: in this case, the number of constraints is `2 ^ 12 = 4096`. The maximum value supported here is `28`, which means you can use `snarkjs` to securely generate zk-snark parameters for circuits with up to `2 ^ 28` (≈268 million) constraints.


### 2. Contribute to the ceremony
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot12_0000.ptau pot12_0001.ptau --name="First contribution" -v
```

The `contribute` command creates a ptau file with a new contribution.

You'll be prompted to enter some random text to provide an extra source of entropy.

`contribute` takes as input the transcript of the protocol so far, in this case `pot12_0000.ptau`, and outputs a new transcript, in this case `pot12_0001.ptau`, which includes the computation carried out by the new contributor (`ptau` files contain a history of all the challenges and responses that have taken place so far).

`name` can be anything you want, and is just included for reference (it will be printed when you verify the file (step 5).

### 3. Provide a second contribution
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot12_0001.ptau pot12_0002.ptau --name="Second contribution" -v -e="some random text"
```

By letting you write the random text as part of the command, the `-e` parameter allows `contribute` to be non-interactive.

### 4. Provide a third contribution using third party software
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau export challenge pot12_0002.ptau challenge_0003
snarkjs powersoftau challenge contribute bn128 challenge_0003 response_0003 -e="some random text"
snarkjs powersoftau import response pot12_0002.ptau response_0003 pot12_0003.ptau -n="Third contribution name"
```

The challenge and response files are compatible with [this software](https://github.com/kobigurk/phase2-bn254).

This allows you to use different types of software in a single ceremony.

### 5. Verify the protocol so far
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau verify pot12_0003.ptau
```

The `verify` command verifies a `ptau` (powers of tau) file. Which means it checks all the contributions to the multi-party computation (MPC) up to that point. It also prints the hashes of all the intermediate results to the console.

If everything checks out, you should see the following at the top of the output:

```sh
[INFO]  snarkJS: Powers Of tau file OK!
```

In sum, whenever a new zk-snark project needs to perform a trusted setup, you can just pick the latest `ptau` file, and run the `verify` command to verify the entire chain of challenges and responses so far.


### 6. Apply a random beacon
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau beacon pot12_0003.ptau pot12_beacon.ptau 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f 10 -n="Final Beacon"
```

The `beacon` command creates a `ptau` file with a contribution applied in the form of a random beacon.

We need to apply a random beacon in order to finalise phase 1 of the trusted setup.

> To paraphrase Sean Bowe and Ariel Gabizon, a random beacon is a source of public randomness that is not available before a fixed time. The beacon itself can be a delayed hash function (e.g. 2^40 iterations of SHA256) evaluated on some high entropy and publicly available data. Possible sources of data include: the closing value of the stock market on a certain date in the future, the output of a selected set of national lotteries, or the value of a block at a particular height in one or more blockchains. E.g. the hash of the 11 millionth Ethereum block (which as of this writing is some 3 months in the future). See [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050.pdf) for more on the importance of a random beacon.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the beacon is essentially a delayed hash function evaluated on `0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f` (in practice this value will be some form of high entropy and publicly available data of your choice). The next input -- in our case `10` -- just tells `snarkjs` to perform `2 ^ 10` iterations of this hash function.

> Note that  [security holds](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050) even if an adversary has limited influence on the beacon.

### 7. Prepare phase 2
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot12_beacon.ptau pot12_final.ptau -v
```

We're now ready to prepare phase 2 of the setup (the circuit-specific phase).

Under the hood,  the `prepare phase2` command calculates the encrypted evaluation of the Lagrange polynomials at tau for `tau`, `alpha*tau` and `beta*tau`. It takes the beacon `ptau` file we generated in the previous step, and outputs a final `ptau` file which will be used to generate the circuit proving and verification keys.

### 8. Verify the final `ptau`
```sh
snarkjs powersoftau verify pot12_final.ptau
```

The `verify` command verifies a powers of tau file.

Before we go ahead and create the circuit, we perform a final check and verify the final protocol transcript.

> Notice there is no longer a warning informing you that the file does not contain phase 2 precalculated values.

### 9. Create the circuit
```sh
cat <<EOT > circuit.circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Multiplier(n) {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output c;

    signal int[n];

    int[0] <== a*a + b;
    for (var i=1; i<n; i++) {
    int[i] <== int[i-1]*int[i-1] + b;
    }

    c <== int[n-1];
}

component main = Multiplier(1000);
EOT
```

We create a circom file that allows us to easily test the system with a different number of constraints.

In this case, we've chosen `1000`,  but we can change this to anything we want (as long as the value we choose is below the number we defined in step 1).

### 10. Compile the circuit
```sh
circom circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
```

The `circom` command takes one input (the circuit to compile, in our case `circuit.circom`) and three options:

- `r1cs`: generates `circuit.r1cs` (the r1cs constraint system of the circuit in binary format).

- `wasm`: generates `circuit.wasm` (the wasm code to generate the witness – more on that later).

- `sym`: generates `circuit.sym` (a symbols file required for debugging and printing the constraint system in an annotated mode).


### 11. View information about the circuit
```sh
snarkjs r1cs info circuit.r1cs
```

The `info` command is used to print circuit stats.

You should see the following output:

```
[INFO]  snarkJS: Curve: bn-128
[INFO]  snarkJS: # of Wires: 1003
[INFO]  snarkJS: # of Constraints: 1000
[INFO]  snarkJS: # of Private Inputs: 2
[INFO]  snarkJS: # of Public Inputs: 0
[INFO]  snarkJS: # of Outputs: 1
```

This information fits with our mental map of the circuit we created: we had two private inputs `a` and `b`, one output `c`, and a thousand constraints of the form `a * b = c.`

### 12. Print the constraints
```sh
snarkjs r1cs print circuit.r1cs circuit.sym
```

To double check, we print the constraints of the circuit.

You should see a thousand constraints of the form:

```
[ -main.int[i] ] * [ main.int[i] ] - [ main.b -main.int[i+1] ] = 0
```

### 13. Export r1cs to json
```sh
snarkjs r1cs export json circuit.r1cs circuit.r1cs.json
cat circuit.r1cs.json
```

We export `r1cs` to `json` format to make it human readable.


### 14. Calculate the witness

First, we create a file with the inputs for our circuit:

```sh
cat <<EOT > input.json
{"a": 3, "b": 11}
EOT
```

Now, we use the Javascript/WASM program created by `circom` in the directory *circuit_js* to create the witness (values of all the wires) for our inputs:

```sh
circuit_js$ node generate_witness.js circuit.wasm ../input.json ../witness.wtns
```

### 15. Setup

Currently, snarkjs supports 2 proving systems: groth16 and PLONK. 

Groth16 requires a trusted ceremony for each circuit. PLONK does not require it, it's enough with the powers of tau ceremony which is universal.

#### Plonk
```sh
snarkjs plonk setup circuit.r1cs pot12_final.ptau circuit_final.zkey
```

You can jump directly to Section 21 as PLONK does not require a specific trusted ceremony.

#### Groth16
```sh
snarkjs groth16 setup circuit.r1cs pot12_final.ptau circuit_0000.zkey
```

This generates the reference `zkey` without phase 2 contributions

IMPORTANT: Do not use this zkey in production, as it's not safe. It requires at least a contribution,

The `zkey new` command creates an initial `zkey` file with zero contributions.

The `zkey` is a zero-knowledge key that includes both the proving and verification keys as well as phase 2 contributions.

Importantly, one can verify whether a `zkey` belongs to a specific circuit or not.

Note that `circuit_0000.zkey` (the output of the `zkey` command above)  does not include any contributions yet, so it cannot be used in a final circuit.

*The following steps (15-20) are similar to the equivalent phase 1 steps, except we use `zkey` instead of `powersoftau` as the main command, and we generate `zkey` rather that `ptau` files.*

### 16. Contribute to the phase 2 ceremony
```sh
snarkjs zkey contribute circuit_0000.zkey circuit_0001.zkey --name="1st Contributor Name" -v
```

The `zkey contribute` command creates a `zkey` file with a new contribution.

As in phase 1, you'll be prompted to enter some random text to provide an extra source of entropy.


### 17. Provide a second contribution
```sh
snarkjs zkey contribute circuit_0001.zkey circuit_0002.zkey --name="Second contribution Name" -v -e="Another random entropy"
```

We provide a second contribution.

### 18. Provide a third contribution using third party software

```sh
snarkjs zkey export bellman circuit_0002.zkey  challenge_phase2_0003
snarkjs zkey bellman contribute bn128 challenge_phase2_0003 response_phase2_0003 -e="some random text"
snarkjs zkey import bellman circuit_0002.zkey response_phase2_0003 circuit_0003.zkey -n="Third contribution name"
```

And a third using [third-party software](https://github.com/kobigurk/phase2-bn254).

### 19. Verify the latest `zkey`
```sh
snarkjs zkey verify circuit.r1cs pot12_final.ptau circuit_0003.zkey
```

The `zkey verify` command verifies a `zkey` file. It also prints the hashes of all the intermediary results to the console.

We verify the `zkey` file we created in the previous step.  Which means we check all the contributions to the second phase of the multi-party computation (MPC) up to that point.

This command also checks that the `zkey` file matches the circuit.

If everything checks out, you should see the following:

```
[INFO]  snarkJS: ZKey Ok!
```

### 20. Apply a random beacon
```sh
snarkjs zkey beacon circuit_0003.zkey circuit_final.zkey 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f 10 -n="Final Beacon phase2"
```

The `zkey beacon` command creates a `zkey` file with a contribution applied in the form of a random beacon.

We use it to apply a random beacon to the latest `zkey` after the final contribution has been made (this is necessary in order to generate a final `zkey` file and finalise phase 2 of the trusted setup).

### 21. Verify the final `zkey`
```sh
snarkjs zkey verify circuit.r1cs pot12_final.ptau circuit_final.zkey
```

Before we go ahead and export the verification key as a `json`, we perform a final check and verify the final protocol transcript (`zkey`).

### 22. Export the verification key
```sh
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey circuit_final.zkey verification_key.json
```
We export the verification key from `circuit_final.zkey` into `verification_key.json`.


### 23. Create the proof

#### PLONK

```sh
snarkjs plonk prove circuit_final.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json
```

#### Groth16

```sh
snarkjs groth16 prove circuit_final.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json
```

We create the proof. this command generates the files `proof.json` and `public.json`: `proof.json` contains the actual proof, whereas `public.json` contains the values of the public inputs and output.

> Note that it's also possible to create the proof and calculate the witness in the same command by running:
> ```sh
> snarkjs groth16 fullprove input.json circuit.wasm circuit_final.zkey proof.json public.json
> ```


### 24. Verify the proof

#### PLONK
```sh
snarkjs plonk verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
```

#### Groth16
```sh
snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
```

We use the this command to verify the proof, passing in the `verification_key` we exported earlier.

If all is well, you should see that `OK` has been outputted to your console. This signifies the proof is valid.


### 25. Turn the verifier into a smart contract
```sh
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier circuit_final.zkey verifier.sol
```

Finally, we export the verifier as a Solidity smart-contract so that we can publish it on-chain -- using [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for example. For the details on how to do this, refer to section 4 of [this tutorial](https://blog.iden3.io/first-zk-proof.html).

### 26. Simulate a verification call
```sh
snarkjs zkey export soliditycalldata public.json proof.json
```

We use `soliditycalldata` to simulate a verification call, and cut and paste the result directly in the verifyProof field in the deployed smart contract in the remix environment.

And voila! That's all there is to it :)


## Using Node

```sh
npm init
npm install snarkjs
```

```js
const snarkjs = require("snarkjs");
const fs = require("fs");

async function run() {
    const { proof, publicSignals } = await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve({a: 10, b: 21}, "circuit.wasm", "circuit_final.zkey");

    console.log("Proof: ");
    console.log(JSON.stringify(proof, null, 1));

    const vKey = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("verification_key.json"));

    const res = await snarkjs.groth16.verify(vKey, publicSignals, proof);

    if (res === true) {
        console.log("Verification OK");
    } else {
        console.log("Invalid proof");
    }

}

run().then(() => {
    process.exit(0);
});
```

## In the browser

Load `snarkjs.min.js` and start using it as usual.

```
cp node_modules/snarkjs/build/snarkjs.min.js .
```


```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Snarkjs client example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Snarkjs client example</h1>
  <button id="bGenProof"> Create proof </button>

  <!-- JS-generated output will be added here. -->
  <pre class="proof"> Proof: <code id="proof"></code></pre>

  <pre class="proof"> Result: <code id="result"></code></pre>


  <script src="snarkjs.min.js">   </script>


  <!-- This is the bundle generated by rollup.js -->
  <script>

const proofCompnent = document.getElementById('proof');
const resultComponent = document.getElementById('result');
const bGenProof = document.getElementById("bGenProof");

bGenProof.addEventListener("click", calculateProof);

async function calculateProof() {

    const { proof, publicSignals } =
      await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve( { a: 3, b: 11}, "circuit.wasm", "circuit_final.zkey");

    proofCompnent.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(proof, null, 1);


    const vkey = await fetch("verification_key.json").then( function(res) {
        return res.json();
    });

    const res = await snarkjs.groth16.verify(vkey, publicSignals, proof);

    resultComponent.innerHTML = res;
}

  </script>

</body>
</html>
```
